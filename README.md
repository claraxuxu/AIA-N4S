# AI_car_V-rep - Epitech School AI project

This is a project of autonomous car, our programme is able to drive the car on a track without touch the walls

And the car knows the correct direction of the track

We use CoppeliaSim as a simulator, you could download them in this website:[Here_for_downloading](https://coppeliarobotics.com/previousVersions)

The file n4s is the binary file of the API, pipes.sh is the shell script for our programme

For complier the programme:
1️⃣   make re
2⃣️   launch the CoppeliaSim
3⃣️   choose a map/a scene(.ttt form) in CoppeliaSim
4⃣️   sh pipes.sh(the car usually could run by itself now)

This is the example:
